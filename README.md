# PPG Signal Processing
This repository contains a collection of techniques and algorithms for processing Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, with a particular focus on signal segmentation and filtering methods. PPG is a non-invasive optical technique used to measure changes in blood volume, which can be used to derive various physiological parameters such as heart rate, respiration rate, and blood oxygen saturation.

# Overview
PPG signals are often contaminated by various sources of noise and artifacts, including motion artifacts, respiratory interference, and baseline wandering. Effective signal segmentation and filtering are crucial steps in extracting meaningful information from these signals. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools and algorithms for addressing these challenges.

# Contents

# Signal Segmentation

Adaptive Segmentation: Algorithms that dynamically adjust the segmentation parameters based on signal characteristics, such as adaptive window sizes or adaptive thresholding.
Wavelet-based Segmentation: Techniques that leverage wavelet transforms to separate the PPG signal into different frequency bands, enabling more effective segmentation and denoising.
Machine Learning-based Segmentation: Approaches that utilize machine learning models, such as neural networks or support vector machines, to learn and identify signal segments of interest.

# Signal Filtering

Frequency-domain Filtering: Methods that operate in the frequency domain, such as band-pass filtering, notch filtering, and adaptive filtering, to remove specific frequency components or isolate the desired signal components.
Adaptive Filtering: Techniques that employ adaptive algorithms, like least mean squares (LMS) or recursive least squares (RLS), to continuously adjust the filter coefficients based on the input signal characteristics.
Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD): Algorithms that decompose the PPG signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), enabling effective denoising and artifact removal.
Wavelet Denoising: Approaches that leverage wavelet transforms to separate noise components from the desired signal components, enabling effective denoising.
